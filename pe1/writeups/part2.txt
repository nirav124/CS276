2.1.1
Searching for author "Rob" returned 408 results.  Lucene does not seem to rank search results in any way, so 
I simply listed the first 20 results.

2.1.2
There were no results for "murdered" and "eighteen" within 5 words of each other. I did find Guilt Complex (2004)
that had them within 7 words and Sommarmord (1994) that had them within 8 words, but nothing within 5.

2.1.3
Searching for simply "10 items or less \(2006\)", backslashes included because the () characters are Lucene terms,
returned the correct movie at position 1, followed by variants in the next three positions:
10 Items or Less (2006)
"10 Items or Less" (2006) {Health Insurance (#1.3)}
"10 Items or Less" (2006) {The New Boss (#1.1)}
"10 Items or Less" (2006) {What Women Want (#1.4)}
Followed by other lesser matches such as 9 Items or Less.  The key to this query is just to recognize that the
() characters need to be escaped.

2.2
Simply doing Rob^1.5 Hart is not succeeding.  It is not anding terms properly; it returns 'Simon Hart' and 'rob'
as authors.  

Putting Rob^1.5 AND Hart returned nothing.

Rob^1.5 AND Hart* returned 337 results.  But this is still not ideal.  We want everything that ends in Hart, with
Rob Hart boosted.  Combine AND and OR?

Combining the two.  I want either last name Hart, or first name Rob last name Hart, with the second boosted. In
Lucene, this query is:
Hart OR (Rob Hart)^1.5

This was still ineffective, because I forgot to make the second query an AND.  I'll leave out wildcards for now
and just search Hart OR (Rob AND Hart)^1.5

Results were not encouraging. Adding wildcards like so:
Hart OR (Rob* AND Hart*)^1.5

I now get Robert Hartill appearing more, but it is still not boosted enough. Altering boost factors.
Hart^.2 OR (Rob* AND Hart*)^5.5

My top 9-20 are now Rob Hartill.  My top 8 are still not-Rob Hart.  Changing boosts again.
Hart^0.01 OR (Rob* AND Hart*)^50

Success! All my top results are now versions of Rob Hartill.  But my last names are different.  Making them match.
(Hart*)^0.01 OR (Rob* AND Hart*)^50

Top matches all still Rob Hartill.  Presumably if you are more sure of the last name, wildcards are unnecessary.
